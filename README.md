# Audio duration until stream setting   

Usually only audio with a duration of 10 Minutes or more are streamed. 

This Module allows to change the minimum duration required for streaming. 

Changing the setting to 30 will stream audio with a duration of 30 seconds+, helpful for people who self-host and uploading a 9-minute song to multiple people would take ages but the bandwidth is enough for streaming.

# Side effects
I do not know what the downsides are for streaming audio.
This Module does only modify one variable, it does not add/modify any code of existing Foundry code, so there should be no compatibility issues.
